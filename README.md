## üîß Technical Highlights

This section details the key engineering decisions made to optimize the system's performance.

-   **Non-Blocking LED Control:** The precise 800kHz signal required by WS2812B LEDs is generated using a combination of **Timer PWM and DMA**. This approach completely offloads the CPU, freeing it up to handle complex effect calculations and UI processing in real-time.
-   **Efficient Audio Sampling:** An **ADC** is used in conjunction with **DMA (in Circular Mode)** to continuously sample the audio signal without CPU intervention, ensuring smooth and responsive music visualization.
-   **High-Speed Display Interface:** The **FSMC** (Flexible Static Memory Controller) peripheral is utilized for a parallel interface with the LCD, achieving significantly higher refresh rates compared to a standard SPI connection.
-   **Robust Software Architecture:** The application is built upon a **State Machine** design pattern, which provides a clear, maintainable, and easily extendable structure for managing different operational modes and effects.

## üöÄ Future Improvements

-   Implement **FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)** for frequency-based audio analysis (e.g., reacting differently to bass, mids, and treble).
-   Design a custom **PCB** to create a more compact and reliable product.
-   Add **wireless connectivity** (Bluetooth or Wi-Fi) to control the effects from a web or mobile application.
